# Domain

The main entity in the GTD domain is the _item_: a task to be carried out in order to get something done.

An item is identified by a _name_, classified by one or more _tags_ and detailed by a _note_. Also an item can be in one of two states: `Pending` or `Done`.

An item can have a _duration_, a level of _energy_ to be invested in it (`Low`, `Medium` or `High`) and a _due date_.

An item may also belong to a _project_.

A project is a long-running activity encompassing multiple items in the pursuit of a well-defined outcome. Like items, a project is identified by a name, classified by one or more tags and detailed by a note.
